### **Overview:**
For this project, I assigned myself the task of creating a portfolio that was responsive and accessible on screens of all sizes. Having a home for all future projects and jobs that I receive. Finding creativity all around me, I designed this portfolio based off a well-worn t-shirt I had been wearing at the start of developing - which reflects my personal style.  Future updates will include contact form functionality


**The following tasks were done to acheive reponsive design and accessibility**
- Added a navigation bar at the top, with a toggle button for smaller devices
- Used Bootstrap grid system so contents are functional on all screens, responsive and design, with no use of media queries
- Used sematic html tags when applicable 
- Added descriptive alt text to all images
- Made sure all coding had clean indentaion, proper commenting, and easy to read order
